# 3‑Minute Pitch Script

Hi, I’m Hugh from PolicyNow. We collect and structure Canadian public perspectives on AI and emerging tech. 
Our "Voices Across Canada" feature turns raw submissions into short blurbs and maps them, with filters for sentiment. 
This gives policymakers a fast read of public sentiment by place and theme.

Today we’re live with BC data and a functioning submission pipeline. Next, we expand nationwide and release monthly digests and open datasets.
PolicyNow offers a visible, accessible record of what people want from AI governance in Canada—so decisions aren’t made in a vacuum.

See the live demo at policynow.ca and this sanitized frontend repo for judging.
