# PolicyNow â€“ Hackathon Submission Overview

**Project:** PolicyNow Canada  
**Track:** Civic tech / AI governance  
**Website:** https://policynow.ca  
**Public Repo:** (this repository)  
**Contact:** Hugh Behroozy

## Summary
PolicyNow turns public input on AI and emerging tech into a usable civic dataset. "Voices Across Canada" summarizes individual submissions into short blurbs and maps them by region with sentiment filters. The dataset supports policymakers, researchers, and civil society.

## Problem
Public engagement with AI policy is fragmented and episodic. Policymakers lack accessible, structured citizen input to inform governance.

## Solution
A persistent platform that collects, summarizes, and maps public sentiment. Outputs include a live feed, a map-based dataset, and monthly digests.

## Why now
Canada can lead in ethical AI governance. PolicyNow provides a scalable, transparent channel for public voice that complements formal consultation.

## Tech
- Next.js frontend (public)  
- Private backend/API + DB (RBAC, RLS)  
- Mapping via client-side tiles  
- AI-assisted summarization for blurbs (roadmap)

## Roadmap
- Expand dataset from BC to all provinces/territories
- Launch partner program for government and civil society
- Add multilingual prompts and regional campaigns
